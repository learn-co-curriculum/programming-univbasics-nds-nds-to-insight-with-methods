# Derive Insight from NDS Using Methods

## Learning Goals

* Wrap uses of `[]` from Step 2 into new method
* Create a "First-Order" method
* Ensure "First-Order Methods" use arguments to create flexibility

## Introduction

In the previous lab we used our knowledge of REPETITION and `Array` syntax to
answer the question: "***How many pieces of snacks are in this vending
machine?***"

But our code didn't take advantage of our ability to create _methods_ to help
our human brains understand what the code was doing. While the previous
implementation _worked_, it's not fun or easy to reason about. In this lesson,
we'll follow step 3 of our process:

> 3. Wrap uses of `[]` from Step 2 into new methods
>   * Create simple methods with meaningful names ("First-Order Methods")
>   * Ensure "First-Order Methods" use arguments to create flexibility

## "Be Smarter, Code Readers"

You might disagree with our assessment that the previous code is "too complex."
Many developers have used the excuse that "it's not ***their*** fault that
***other people*** aren't smart enough to read ***their*** (brilliant) code."

Baloney.

Readability is a real concern for our code. Remember, we want computers to run
our code, but it's more important that humans understand our problem-solving
process. A good guideline for when our code is clean enough is "the 3 a.m.
rule."

Your guiding rule of thumb should be "can a reasonable person understand this
code at 3 am on 3 hours of sleep 3 weeks from now?" If you can honestly say,
"Yes. This is the most understandable I can do right now," then you've probably
gotten clean enough. 

Our guideline comes from the idea of being an "on-call" support
programmer.  You're warm and cozy in bed. Suddenly your phone (pager?) goes
off: site is down, it's the day before your biggest online sales day. You go
to look at the code that's sending out the error and you see...(your code
here)...if you, in this exercise of empathy, feel like crying, then you
should clean up your code more. If you feel like you've given your future
self and other developers a strong, understandable basis for fixing things,
you've met the guideline.


## Wrap Uses of `[]` from Step 2 into new method

At the end of the previous lesson, our solution to calculate the number of
pieces of snacks in the vending machine looked like this:

```ruby
vm = [[[{:name=>"Vanilla Cookies", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Pistachio Cookies", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Chocolate Cookies", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Chocolate Chip Cookies", :pieces=>3}], [{:name=>"Tooth-Melters", :pieces=>12}, {:name=>"Tooth-Destroyers", :pieces=>12}, {:name=>"Enamel Eaters", :pieces=>12}, {:name=>"Dentist's Nighmare", :pieces=>20}], [{:name=>"Gummy Sour Apple", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Gummy Apple", :pieces=>5}, {:name=>"Gummy Moldy Apple", :pieces=>1}]], [[{:name=>"Grape Drink", :pieces=>1}, {:name=>"Orange Drink", :pieces=>1}, {:name=>"Pineapple Drink", :pieces=>1}], [{:name=>"Mints", :pieces=>13}, {:name=>"Curiously Toxic Mints", :pieces=>1000}, {:name=>"US Mints", :pieces=>99}]]]


grand_piece_total = 0
row_index = 0
while row_index < vm.length do
  column_index = 0
  while column_index < vm[row_index].length do
    inner_len = vm[row_index][column_index].length
    inner_index = 0
    while inner_index < inner_len do
      # vm[row][column][spinner]
      # spinner is full of Hashes with keys :pieces and :name
      grand_piece_total += vm[row_index][column_index][inner_index][:pieces]
      inner_index += 1
    end
    column_index += 1
  end
  row_index += 1
end

p grand_piece_total #=> 1192
```

Zoom in to where we introduced our comments. Generally, comments that explain
***why*** something is done like `# Added because of Bug #123123, don't remove the
following reset!` or that document some really tricky bit of code like `#
Optimization seen in blog post http://example.com/101-ways-to-speed-up-an-application#32`
are great additions to code.

***However***, this comment is a little different, it's here because our code
is really hard to understand. As programmer Brian Kernighan once said: "Don't
comment bad code ‚Äê rewrite it." One of the best ways to "rewrite" complex code
is to put its work or "thinking" inside of a _method_ with a meaningful name.

Let's zoom-in on this commented bit of code:

```ruby
# Invalid code, can't be pasted into IRB!
    inner_index = 0
    while inner_index < inner_len do
    # vm[row][column][spinner]
    # spinner is full of Hashes with keys :pieces and :name
    grand_piece_total += vm[row_index][column_index][inner_index][:pieces]
    inner_index += 1
    end
    column_index += 1
```

Inside this code two key things happen:

1. We total up the pieces in each of the snacks on a vending machine "spinner"
2. We "accumulate" that number to a grand total.

Wouldn't the code be simpler if we had a method that could
`total_snack_pieces_on_spinner`? For each spinner in the row we'd hand the
spinner to our method and the method would return the total number of snacks on
the spinner?

Then, we'd accumulate those returned spinner totals to a grand total.

Beginners are often staggered by the idea we just presented, that we can just
add code the thing into existence that would make our lives better. But ...
Yes! We can! And we should!

We'll call this method `total_snack_pieces_on_spinner`. It will take as
arguments

* the NDS
* the row coordinate
* and the column coordinate

and return the total number of snack pieces on that spinner.

The implementation of `total_snack_pieces_on_spinner` will largely be a
cut-and-paste of the complex code we're pointed out earlier that we had to
comment.

```ruby
vm = [[[{:name=>"Vanilla Cookies", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Pistachio Cookies", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Chocolate Cookies", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Chocolate Chip Cookies", :pieces=>3}], [{:name=>"Tooth-Melters", :pieces=>12}, {:name=>"Tooth-Destroyers", :pieces=>12}, {:name=>"Enamel Eaters", :pieces=>12}, {:name=>"Dentist's Nighmare", :pieces=>20}], [{:name=>"Gummy Sour Apple", :pieces=>3}, {:name=>"Gummy Apple", :pieces=>5}, {:name=>"Gummy Moldy Apple", :pieces=>1}]], [[{:name=>"Grape Drink", :pieces=>1}, {:name=>"Orange Drink", :pieces=>1}, {:name=>"Pineapple Drink", :pieces=>1}], [{:name=>"Mints", :pieces=>13}, {:name=>"Curiously Toxic Mints", :pieces=>1000}, {:name=>"US Mints", :pieces=>99}]]]

def total_snack_pieces_on_spinner(nds, row_index, column_index)
  coordinate_total = 0
  inner_len = nds[row_index][column_index].length
  inner_index = 0
  while inner_index < inner_len do
    coordinate_total += nds[row_index][column_index][inner_index][:pieces]
    inner_index += 1
  end
  coordinate_total
end

grand_piece_total = 0
row_index = 0
while row_index < vm.length do
  column_index = 0
  while column_index < vm[row_index].length do
    grand_piece_total += total_snack_pieces_on_spinner(vm, row_index, column_index)
    column_index += 1
  end
  row_index += 1
end

p grand_piece_total #=> 1192
```

Take a look at that code. See how it's easier to read? We're iterating through
grid coordinates and, for each coordinate pair, we're asking some other bit of
thinking called `total_pieces_on_first_spinner` to tell us how many pieces of
snack are present in the spinner. We don't have to think about the
implementation of `total_pieces_on_first_spinner`.

This is the heart of programming: building small little methods that make it
easy for humans to reason about how we asked a computer to help us figure
something out. Programmers call this "managing complexity." To quote guru Brian
Kernighan:

> Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming.

## Create a "First-Order" Method

We call `total_pieces_on_first_spinner` a "First-Order Method." It wraps the
basic Ruby `Array` and REPETITION code in a meaningful name. It's much easier
for our human brains to say "iterate through the coordinates and, for each one,
sum up the pieces found in each snack" than to think about all the `while` and
`do` and `end` ....noise. While computers require us to talk to them using Ruby
primitives, we can teach _them_ how to think in a way that works for ***us***
and other code readers.

## Ensure "First-Order Methods" Use Arguments to Create Flexibility

It's worth taking a moment to consider the arguments to
`total_snack_pieces_on_spinner`. We **didn't** write
`total_pieces_on_first_spinner`, and `total_pieces_on_second_spinner`, and
`total_pieces_on_third_spinner`, ...  and so on. We saw that the dimensions of
our vending machine NDS might change (more rows, `1,000`, `1,000,000`,
`1,000,000,000` even!). As long as we can simply increment integers
(`row_index` and `column_index`), our code ***works***.

You might recall that the process of making methods that are flexible based on
arguments is called _abstraction_. We should endeavor to make our methods
appropriately _abstract_. We can make them too abstract and not abstract
enough. How to decide if you're in the sweet spot? Sadly, that takes experience
and flexibility. Again, let the "3 a.m. rule" be your guide.

## Lab

In the lab you're going to work with the directors NDS again and clean up your
implementation from the previous lesson. You're going to be prompted to create
a "First-order method" that will make your code cleaner.

## Conclusion

While the _insight_ we discovered in this has remained the same from the last
lesson, you should find this code easier to scan and understand. Wrapping
"working code" inside of methods that make the code easier to work with is a
vital step in code mastery.
